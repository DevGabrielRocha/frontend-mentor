## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Font import from google fonts

### What I learned

This is my first project on the mentor frontend, I haven't made a project with just a few instructions yet. I really liked it because I could practice my knowledge in semantic HTML5, css custom properties, and GIT and GITHUB.

### Continued development

I will study more about Sass, I saw the recommendation in the instructions, but I don't know much about it yet.

### Useful resources
